	<h2>#hackPHX</h2>

	<h4>Your quest, should you choose to accept is .. Arduino!</h4>
	You'll have ~12 hours to build whatever you want using an Arduino, our secret ingredient, the hackerspace's resources, and a small budget to buy additional stuff from Walmart, Radioshack, Craigslist, etc. Near the end of the ~12 hour period judges will pick their favorite, and participants will award the Jury prize, but we promise everyone will go home with hardware.
